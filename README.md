# **Business Task**

Analyse smart device data usage in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and use those insights to guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. 

# **Objectives (Ask)**

• Identify trends on non-Bellabeat smart device usage 
• Find ways to connect these trends to Bellabeat customers 
• Identify ways that these trends can help to influence Bellabeat marketing strategy 

# **Key stakeholders** 

• Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer 
• Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s co-founder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team 
• Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. 

# **Scope of the study** 

The study is limited to analysing public datasets from non Bellabeat tracking devices. 
Methodology 

Follow Google Analytics methodology in analysing datasets. The phases of data analysis followed are as follows: 
1. Ask 
2. Prepare 
3. Process 
4. Analysis 
5. Share 
6. Act

# **First Dataset**

 Fitabase Dataset The main dataset used for analysis is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). It contains 18 CSV files with data provided by thirty three eligible Fitbit users. The users consented to the submission of personal tracker data and made it available to the public. The dataset has some limitations as discussed below: 
 
• Outdated: last updated 4 years ago. The data was collected 8 years ago in 2016. 

• Short duration; Only 31 days (i.e. 2016/04/12 to 2016/05/12) 

• Small sample; Only 33 respondents compared to a global population of fitness tracker users. 

• No gender description; since Bellabeat is mainly focused on women health products, dataset dominated by women respondents would have been more relevant.

•	No geological location provided; there might be sampling bias if the users are all concentrated in one geological location.


# **Second Dataset**

MI Band Data set A dataset Source on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damirgadylyaev/more-than-4-years-of-steps-and-sleep-data-mi-band). A user uploaded the dataset containing his physical activity and sleep monitoring data. The dataset contains data from 27/04/2016 to 14/01/2023. Device used Mi Band Xiaomi. Issues with dataset: 

• 15 days have zero values. Users claims values were corrupted. 

• Some sleep days were not recorded. The user claims that he was sleeping during the day and the device does not measure day sleeping. 

# **Third Dataset**

MI Fitbit dataset A data set uploaded on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulgarg123/mi-fitbit-dataset) by a user. It contains physical activity data, sleep and heart rate data for a period of one year. The data was recorded using MI Fitbit device. Data recorded from 2018/09/29 to 2019/11/18. Issues with dataset:
 • Many data points have duplicates.

 # **Conclusion** 
 
Most users of tracking devices are female which gives Bellabeat an added advantage. The market is expected to grow which gives Bellabeat an opportunity to grow. 
The conclusion and recommendations will be based on the three datasets analysed in this study. The sample size is small compared to the population that uses health trackers however, with more data from literature study it is can assist in improving Bellabeat marketing strategy. 

The following are the major conclusion reached. 

•	Most respondents used health tracking devices consistently 

•	All respondents tracked calories, steps, physical activity and corresponding duration.  

•	72 % of the respondents monitored their sleep pattern, 42 % monitored their heart rate and only 24 % measured their weight.

•	Respondents spent more time inactive 

•	Respondents are mostly active in the afternoon from 17:00 to just before 20:00 and midday from 12:00 to just before 15:00 

•	Respondents clocked an average of 7 600 steps a day which is below the recommended steps. 

•	Respondents that tracked their sleeping pattern receive the recommended amount of sleep. 

•	42 % of the respondents that tracked their heart health had normal heart rate. 

# **Insights from the Conclusion:**
1.	Target Demographics Advantage:
o	Most users of health tracking devices are female, aligning well with Bellabeat’s focus on women’s health. This demographic alignment can strengthen Bellabeat's market positioning and marketing campaigns.
2.	Market Growth Opportunity:
o	The growing health tracker market presents an opportunity for Bellabeat to expand its product offerings and reach a broader audience.
3.	Consistency in Usage:
o	Most respondents consistently use health tracking devices, indicating high engagement. Bellabeat can capitalize on this by emphasizing features that enhance user engagement and long-term commitment.
4.	Focus on Popular Tracking Features:
o	High tracking rates for calories, steps, physical activity, and sleep indicate these are key features to prioritize in marketing and product development. Features like weight and heart rate tracking could be better highlighted to increase their adoption.
5.	Behavioral Insights:
o	The majority of respondents were inactive for extended periods and primarily active during two key windows (midday and early evening). Bellabeat can design campaigns or app features to encourage activity during inactive periods.
6.	Health Insights:
o	Respondents' average step count (7,600 steps/day) is below the recommended level. This could be an opportunity for Bellabeat to launch motivational challenges or insights to help users achieve their fitness goals.
o	Those who track their sleep patterns meet recommended sleep levels, suggesting Bellabeat should continue emphasizing sleep tracking features in its marketing.
o	42% of heart health trackers had normal heart rates, which might point to an educational opportunity about heart health for Bellabeat users.
7.	Data Sample Considerations:
o	The study's sample size is relatively small. Bellabeat should consider gathering more extensive data, possibly through user surveys or partnerships, to validate these insights and refine strategies.
Recommendations Based on Insights:
•	Personalized Marketing: Focus on targeting female users with personalized messaging highlighting how Bellabeat devices support popular tracking activities like sleep and physical activity.
•	Educational Campaigns: Educate users on the benefits of underutilized features like heart rate and weight tracking.
•	Behavior Modification Features: Incorporate app features or notifications encouraging users to reduce inactivity during off-peak times.
•	Step Challenges: Create challenges or gamified experiences to help users reach and exceed 10,000 steps per day.
•	Data Collection and Analysis: Invest in gathering larger and more diverse datasets to improve insights and refine product offerings.
